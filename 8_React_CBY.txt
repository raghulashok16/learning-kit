WHY REACT IS SO POPULAR
1. brfore react was created, when our web page loaded in a browser, our browser create tree like structure with our html code.
2. this tree structure is called document object model[DOM].
3. by using this dom in javascript, we can add various functionality for our application like hiding bar on button click, click handling form inputs, etc.
4. with our vanilla javascript we need to type large number of lines to manage big applications.
5. with this approach it is hard to manage and very messy while solving bugs.
6. so in react we dont need to worry about the vanilla javascript code.
7. beacuse in react we divide our application into small piece of code called components.
8. and react will take care of creating and updating dom.
9. components is used to reusable and better organized code.
