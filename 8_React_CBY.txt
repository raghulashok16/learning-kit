WHAT IS REACT
1. it is an open source javascript library used for building frontend applications.
2. with react we can create fast and better frontend application.
3. react was created by facebook in 2011.
4. currently it is the most popoular and most used javascript  frontend library.
<------------------------------->

WHY REACT IS SO POPULAR
1. before react was created, when our web page loaded in a browser, our browser create tree like structure with our html code.
2. this tree structure is called document object model[DOM].
3. by using this dom in javascript, we can add various functionality for our application like hiding side bar on button click, handling form inputs, etc.
4. to achive these functionality with vanilla javascript we need to type large number of lines.
5. with this approach it is hard to manage and very messy while work on large applications.
6. so in react we dont need to worry about the vanilla javascript code.
7. beacuse in react we divide our application into small piece of code called components.
8. and react will take care of creating and updating dom.
9. components is used to write reusable and better organized code.
10. we buid all components individually and then combine them to build our page.
11. so by creating small components we can easily manage our code and our application also works fast.
12. with react we can create single page application which means our application loads only one time.
13. and all pages comes without reloading the entire page.
14. this will make our application almost 50% faster than normal applications.
<------------------------------->

VIRTUAL DOM
1. react is so fast because of the virtual dom feature.
2. when we create a web page with react it will maintain a virtual representation of your webpage.
3. so this virtual representaion is called vitual dom.
4. whenever we want to update our webpage, we describe the changes to the virtual dom.
5. actualy we dont directly modify the real dom, reacts virtual dom efficienty compares the new virtual dom.
6. by this way react will know which compoents should be removed and which components should be added based on the virtual dom comparison.
7. in this approach, we will update only necessary things and we dont need to load the whole page.
8. Virtual dom makes updating the real dom smoother and more efficient, and it ehances the performance and increaces the user experiences.
<------------------------------->

SOFTWARES REQUIRED
1. node js[node pakacge manager is used to install react and some aditional features]
2. code editor[visual studio code]
3. es7/react snippets in vs code.
3. browser[chrome recommended]
<------------------------------->

CREATING REACT APP
1. create react app [method 1]
2. vite [method 2]
3. creact react app is old way and it take much time compare to vite.
<------------------------------->

CREATING REACT APP WITH VITE
1. go to our project folder and run vite command in the terminal.
# npm create vite@latest
2. tpye your project_name and hit enter.
3. select the framework[react] and hit enter.
4. select javascript[recomended for basic projects] or typescript[recomended for typecscript projects] base and hit enter.
5. now we need to change directory
# cd project_name
6. we need to install some pakages like webpack, babel, etc.
# npm install
7. open the project in vs code and open the terminal and launch with the below command.
# npm run dev
8. it will show the link of our application[localhost link]
<------------------------------->

INSIDE VITE REACT TEMPLATE
1. we have node folder where we have all the required pakages and libraries for our application.
2. without node modules we cant run our application and that is why we use # npm install command.
3. finally we dont touch this foler.
4. in src folder we spend all the time writing our code.
5. in assers folder we put all our images, icons, fonts, etc.
6. app.jsx is the root component of our application.
7. app.jsx is the starting pont of the component chain and it is called root component.
8. .jsx is the extension the react component but it is similar to the js file.
9. unlike normal html code we use jsx[javascript XML].
10. with jsx we can write HTML and javascript code together and this is the heart of the react application.
11. we need to export default component so that we can use that in the other component.
12.
