# ------------ 221. CHALLENGE 1: Understand "The Atomic Blog" App ------------ #
# ----------------------- 222. What is the Context API? ---------------------- #
✅ 1. when we pass state into multiple deeply nested child components, we involve in a concept called prop drilling.
✅ 2. prop drilling is not prefered by developers beacuse it is very hard to find the flow of data and in debugging.
✅ 3. so react created a method to pass the state from parent to deeply located child component directly without prop drilling.
✅ 4. so that concept was called context API.
✅ 5. when we use context api, it allows us to read state from everywhere in the tree.
✅ 6. in other words, context api is system to pass data throughout the app without manually passing props down the tree.
✅ 7. it allows us to "broadcast" global state to the entire app.
✅ 8. PROVIDER   - gives all child components access to value.
✅ 9. VALUE      - data that we want to make available (usually state and functions)
✅ 10. CONSUMERS - all components that read the provided context value.
✅ 11. usually PROVIDER wraps around the APP component.
✅ 12. whenever the VALUE is updated all CONSUMERS will be re-render.

# ------------------- 223. Creating and Providing a Context ------------------ #
✅ 1. create a custom context using createContext() method.

    const PostContext = createContext();

✅ 2. here PostContext is considered as a component so that it starts with the uppercase.
✅ 3. now wrap the desired component using our custom context we created earlier.
🚩🚩🚩🚩
    <PostContext.Provider>
        <parentcomponent>
            <childcomponent>
                ...any child component and son on...
            </childcomponent>
        </parentcomponent>
    </PostContext.Provider>
⚡⚡⚡⚡


✅ 4. after wrapping, provide the values to the child component using provider.
🚩🚩🚩🚩
    <PostContext.Provider 
    value = {{
        posts: searchPosts,
        onAddPost: handleAddPost,
        onClearPost: handleClearPosts,
        searchQuery,
        setSearchQuery,
    }}>
        <parentcomponent>
            <childcomponent>
                ...any child component and son on...
            </childcomponent>
        </parentcomponent>
    </PostContext.Provider>
⚡⚡⚡⚡


# ------------------------ 224. Consuming the Context ------------------------ #
✅ 1. to consume a context, there is a special react hook called useContext().
✅ 2. this will return all the states and handler functions we passed in the value of the context provider.
🚩🚩🚩🚩
    const { onClearPost } = useContext(PostContext);
⚡⚡⚡⚡


✅ 3. it is important to mention which context we are consuming from inside the useContext().
✅ 4. also we can destruct the value object for our required things.
✅ 5. by this way we can avoid prop drilling.

# ------------- 225. Advanced Pattern: A Custom Provider and Hook ------------ #
✅ 1. this topic is a advanced pattern of context api.
✅ 2. note: the implementation of PROVIDER, VALUE & CONSUMERS are located on the same file.
✅ 3. note: this above implementation will also work, but separating the provider code in a separate file is a good practise because it makes the code redability when we work on huge projects.
✅ 4. the key idea is to separate the state and the state updating logic into a separate into our own custom context provider component.
✅ 5. now create a file named PostContext.js inside the src folder.
🚩🚩🚩🚩
    const PostContext = createContext();
⚡⚡⚡⚡


✅ 6. add the createContext before creating the provider function.
✅ 7. next step is to create a function which is use to act as a provider.
🚩🚩🚩🚩
    function PostProvider() {
        ... copy all the state and state updating logics here...
        return(
            <PostContext.Provider 
                value = {{
                    posts: searchPosts,
                    onAddPost: handleAddPost,
                    onClearPost: handleClearPosts,
                    searchQuery,
                    setSearchQuery,
            }}>
            </PostContext.Provider>
        )
    }
⚡⚡⚡⚡


✅ 8. now wrap the desired component using PostProvider component as below.
🚩🚩🚩🚩
    <PostProvider>
         <parentcomponent>
            <childcomponent>
                ...any child component and son on...
            </childcomponent>
        </parentcomponent>
    </PostProvider>    
⚡⚡⚡⚡


✅ 9. after this step we have to mention that some children are comming in as prop.
✅ 10. so that the PostProvider compont can give access to the values.
🚩🚩🚩🚩
    function PostProvider({children}) {
        
    }
⚡⚡⚡⚡


✅ 11. also use the children prop in the return statement.
🚩🚩🚩🚩
    return(
        <PostContext.Provider 
                value = {{
                    posts: searchPosts,
                    onAddPost: handleAddPost,
                    onClearPost: handleClearPosts,
                    searchQuery,
                    setSearchQuery,
        }}>
        {children}
        </PostContext.Provider>
    )
⚡⚡⚡⚡


✅ 12. Note: instead of default exporting, use name exports in the PostContext file.
🚩🚩🚩🚩
    export { PostProvider, PostContext };
⚡⚡⚡⚡


✅ 13. we can also encapsulate the consumer useContext(PostContext).
🚩🚩🚩🚩
    function usePosts() {
        const context = useContext( PostContext );
        return context;
    }
⚡⚡⚡⚡


✅ 14. after this we can change the name of the named export as below.
🚩🚩🚩🚩
    export { PostProvider, usePosts };
⚡⚡⚡⚡


✅ 15. in the consumer component we can use the consumer code like the below, which looks very encapsulated.
🚩🚩🚩🚩
    const { onClearPost } = usePosts();
⚡⚡⚡⚡


✅ 16. this is a good practise used by the developers because it seperates all logic inside the same file and secured.
✅ 17. in certain case context will be used outside the provider by mistake.
✅ 18. this can be identified by throwing custom errors.
🚩🚩🚩🚩
    function usePosts() {
        const context = useContext( PostContext );
        if( context === undefined ){
            throw new Error("PostContext was used outside of the PostProvider");
        }
        return context;
    }
⚡⚡⚡⚡


✅ 19. the above code will throw error if the context used outside.
