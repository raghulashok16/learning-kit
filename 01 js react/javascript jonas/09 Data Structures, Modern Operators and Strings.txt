# ------------------------- 103. Destructuring Arrays ------------------------ #
📝NOTES📝
    - while destructuring array use [] square brackets.
    - here "restaurant" is a object and "categories" is a array.

1. destructuring array elements using es6.
👇
const arr = [2, 3, 4];
const [x, y, z] = arr;
const [first, second] = restaurant.categories;
☝

2. skip elements in array destructuring.
👇
const [first, , third] = restaurant.categories;
☝

3. array destructuring to swap variables.
\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\
    [a, b] = [b, a];
//////////////////////////////////////////////

4. destructuring nested array.
\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\
    const nested = [2, 4, [5, 6]];
    const [ i, , [j, k]] = nested;
//////////////////////////////////////////////

5. setting default values in destructuring.
\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\
    const [a = 2, b = 1, c = 8] = [8, 9];
//////////////////////////////////////////////

# ------------------------ 105. Destructuring Objects ------------------------ #

NOTE: 
    - while destructuring objects use {} curly braces.
    - we need to write the exact property names in object destructuring.
    - destructuring allows us to write less code.
    - this will be very helpfull when we work with API.

1.  destructuring object using exact object property names.
\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\
    const { name, openingHours, categories } = restaurant;
//////////////////////////////////////////////

2. destructuring object using renamed object property names.
\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\
    const { name: restaurantName, openingHours: hours, categories: tags } = restaurant;
//////////////////////////////////////////////

3. we can also set default values while destructuring object.
\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\
    const { menu = [], starterMenu: staters = [] } = restaurant;
//////////////////////////////////////////////

4. we can mutate variables while destructuring objects.
\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\
    let a = 111;
    let b = 999;
    const obj = { a: 23, b: 7, c:14 };
    ({ a, b } = obj);
//////////////////////////////////////////////

5. destructuring nested object.
\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\
    const { fri: { open, close } } = openingHours;
//////////////////////////////////////////////

\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\
    const { fri: { open: o, close: c } } = openingHours;
//////////////////////////////////////////////

6. destructuring object at function argument.
\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\
    function orderInRestaurant ({ starterIndex, mainIndex, time, address }){
        ...
    }
//////////////////////////////////////////////

7. destructuring object at function argument with default values.
\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\
    function orderInRestaurant ({ starterIndex = 1, mainIndex = 0, time = '20:00', address }){
        ...
    }
//////////////////////////////////////////////

# ---------------------- 106. The Spread Operator (...) ---------------------- #

NOTE:
    - this operator is used to expand an array into all of its individual elements.
    - mainly used to take shallow copy of array and to merge two arrays.
    - Spread operator works on all iterables [arrays, strings, maps, sets, etc] but not objects.
    - we cannot use spread inside the template/string Literals.


1. creating an new array with existing arrays.
👇👇👇
    const newArr = [...arr1, ...arr2];
☝☝☝

2. creating an new array by add a element with an existing array.
\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\
    const newMenu = [...restaurant.mainMenu, 'Gnocci'];
//////////////////////////////////////////////

3. take copy of an array.
\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\
    const mainMenuCopy = [...restaurant.mainMenu];
//////////////////////////////////////////////

4. join 2 arrays.
\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\
    const menu = [...restaurant.starterMenu, ...restaurant.mainMenu];
////////////////////////////////////////////// 

5. manipulating strings.
\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\
    const str = 'Jonas';
    const strArr = [...str];
//////////////////////////////////////////////

6. calling functions by spreading arguments.
\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\
    restaurant.orderPasta(...ingredients);
//////////////////////////////////////////////
