# ---------------------- 5. Using Browser Router Element --------------------- #
✅ 1. app functional component is the core container component of the whole project.
✅ 2. react dev tools is must so install that chrome extension in the chrome web store.
✅ 3. it helps view the components in our react app using the chrome dev tool.
✅ 4. now install 'react-router-dom' using 'npm i react-router-dom' command.
✅ 5. after installing import 'browser-router' using the below code.
🚩🚩🚩🚩
    import {BrowserRouter} from "react-router-dom";
    import {BrowserRouter as Router} from "react-router-dom";
⚡⚡⚡⚡


📝📝📝📝NOTES
    - react consists of react-router-dom and react-router-native.
    - react-router-dom consists dom related apis.
    - react-router-native consits of native related apis.

✅ 6. in the above imports the methods are same but in the second import we conditionally renamed the BrowserRouter as Router.
✅ 7. using 'Router' is something meaningfull.
✅ 8. this browser-router must wrap all the visuall ui component we create using react.
✅ 9. for example, we can wrap it around app component or we can use it inside app component and wrap it around other components.

Method 1:
🚩🚩🚩🚩
    function App(){
        return (
            <>
                <Router>Hiii</Router>
            </>
        )
    }
⚡⚡⚡⚡


Method 2:
🚩🚩🚩🚩
    <Router>
        <App/>
    </Router>
⚡⚡⚡⚡


# ---------------------------- 6. Declaring Paths ---------------------------- #
✅ 1. the main usecase of react-router is to show/render different components based on the url/link/button we click.
✅ 2. to achive that 'browser-router' is not enough, we need to import other 2 important component which is 'Routes' and 'Route'.
🚩🚩🚩🚩
    import {BrowserRouter, Routes, Route} from "react-router-dom";
⚡⚡⚡⚡


✅ 3. with 'Route' we are going to specify which component is going to render in which url.
✅ 4. multiple 'Route' can be specified inside 'Routes' component.
✅ 5. every 'Route' consists two configurations one is path and another one is element.
✅ 6. '/' is the home route path.
🚩🚩🚩🚩
    localhost:3000/contact
    localhost:3000/cart
    localhost:3000/products
⚡⚡⚡⚡


✅ 7. '/contact' '/cart' '/products' are the example of route path.
✅ 8. when we run this link in the browser the required path will be rendered based on the match.
🚩🚩🚩🚩
    <Router>
        <Routes>
            <Route path='/' element={<HomePage/>} />
            <Route path='/books' element={<Books/>} />
        </Routes>
    </Router>
⚡⚡⚡⚡


✅ 9. here you have to create this <HomePage/> and <Books/> component.

# ----------------------------- 7. Styling Paths ----------------------------- #
✅ 1. using syleed components is a way of creating components.
✅ 2. it reduces to create new files separate for css.

# -------------------------- 8. 404 Not Found Routes ------------------------- #
✅ 1. when the path name does not match the url in uor router, the component will not render anything.
✅ 2. this tell user nothing about the problem occured.
✅ 3. to overcome this issue we can specify a default error page when no url match the route path.
🚩🚩🚩🚩
    <Router>
        <Routes>
            <Route path='/' element={<HomePage/>} />
            <Route path='/books' element={<Books/>} />
            <Route path='*' element={<ErrorPage/>} />
        </Routes>
    </Router>
⚡⚡⚡⚡


✅ 4. now if any url dont match then react will render the <ErrorPage/> component.
✅ 5. specifying '*' at last route is very important.


# ------------------------- 9. Redirecting 404 Routes ------------------------ #
✅ 1. Redirecting to a specific page is achived using navigate component.
✅ 2. to do so we need to install 'Navigate'.
🚩🚩🚩🚩
    import {BrowserRouter, Routes, Route, Navigate} from "react-router-dom";
⚡⚡⚡⚡


✅ 3. we need to use the navigate component in the wildcard route.
✅ 4. inside the navigate component we need to give a specific path name.
🚩🚩🚩🚩
    <Router>
        <Routes>
            <Route path='/' element={<HomePage/>} />
            <Route path='/books' element={<Books/>} />
            <Route path='*' element={<Navigate to='/login' />} />
        </Routes>
    </Router>
⚡⚡⚡⚡


✅ 5. this is very helpfull when a user try to access a forbiden url path.
✅ 6. then react will Redirect them to the login page or our desired page.
