# ------------------------- Action VS Action Creator ------------------------- #
✅ 1. Action - it is simply a javascript object that contains information about an event that has occured in your app.
✅ 2. Action Creator - these are functions that create and return actions.
✅ 3. Action Properties - it is a plain obect, it has a type field as a property which is a required, it is an event that occurs in your application, it can accept additional properties(payload), a function that returns an action is called an action creator.

# ----------------------------- Installing Redux ----------------------------- #
✅ 1. the below is the command to install redux in plain js project.
🔻🔻🔻🔻🔻🔻
    npm init --yes
    npm i redux
🔺🔺🔺


✅ 2. create a file in the project folder "counter.js".

# ------------------------- Action and Action Creator ------------------------ #
✅ 1. to work with redux we have to follow some steps to create the dataflow.
✅ 2. STEPS: -> Initial State -> Action Creator -> Reducer -> Store.
✅ 3. first create the initial state.
🚩🚩🚩🚩
    const initialState = {
        count: 0,
    };
⚡⚡⚡⚡


✅ 4. create the actions and action creators for the project.
🚩🚩🚩🚩
    {
        type: "INCREMENT";
    }
    {
        type: "DECREMENT";
    }
    {
        type: "RESET";
    }
    {
        type: "INCREMENT_BY_AMOUNT";
    }
⚡⚡⚡⚡
🚩🚩🚩🚩
    const incrementAction = () ={
        return {
            type: "INCREMENT",
        };
    }
    const decrementAction = () ={
        return {
            type: "DECREMENT",
        };
    }
    const resetAction = () ={
        return {
            type: "RESET",
        };
    }
    const incrementByAmountAction = (amount) ={
        return {
            type: "INCREMENT_BY_AMOUNT",
            payload: amount,
        };
    }

# ---------------------------- Rules of a Reducer ---------------------------- #
✅ 1. Reducer - it is a function that recevies the current state and an action object, decides how to update the state base on the action, and returns the new state.
✅ 2. the current state is the state inside the STORE.

RULES:
✅ 1. the new state value should only be calculated based on the state and action arguments.
✅ 2. reducers are not allowed to modify the existing state.

# ---------------------------- Reducer in Practice --------------------------- #
🚩🚩🚩🚩
    const counterReducer = ( state = initialState, action ) => {
        if(action.type === "INCREMENT"){
            return{
                count: state.count + 1,
            };
        };
    };
⚡⚡⚡⚡


# ----------------------------- Redux Store Setup ---------------------------- #
✅ 1. redux stores the application data.
✅ 2. it does not contain bussiness logic.
✅ 3. it recevies actions and pass to all the registered middleware.
✅ 4. the only way to change the state inside it is to dispatch an action.
✅ 5. when it recevies an action that causes a change to the state, the store will notify all the registered listners that a change to the state has been made. this will  allow various parts of the system, like the UI, to update themselves according to the new state.
✅ 6. to create a store in vanilla javascript we need to use this below code.
🚩🚩🚩🚩
    const { createStore } = require("redux");
⚡⚡⚡⚡
🚩🚩🚩🚩
    const store = createStore(counterReducer);
    const stateData = store.getState();
    console.log(stateData);
⚡⚡⚡⚡

📝📝📝📝NOTES
    - this "require" method wont work in react [react uses "import" method ]

# -------------------------- How To Dispatch Actions ------------------------- #
✅ 1. dispatch method is the only way to trigger a state change.
🚩🚩🚩🚩
    store.dispatch(incrementAction());
⚡⚡⚡⚡


✅ 2. to view the updated state in the store we need a special method called subscribe.
🚩🚩🚩🚩
    store.subscribe(()=>{
        const data = store.getState();
        console.log(data);
    });
⚡⚡⚡⚡


✅ 3. this methods will be triggered all the time when the state changes.
✅ 4. try to write the subscribe method above the dispatch method.
✅ 5. while dispatching an action, the action type must be in the reducer otherwise it will return "undefined".
✅ 6. to overcome this problem always return the previous state as the default when using reducer with SWITCH case.

# ----------------------- Dispatch Actions With Payload ---------------------- #
✅ 1. action is a object which has data - type and payload.
✅ 2. we can access these using 'action.type' and 'ation.paylaod'.
✅ 3. passing action type is mandatory and action payload can be used as our preference.
🚩🚩🚩🚩
    store.dispatch(incrementByAmountAction(10));
