1. 'html' stands for hypertext markup language.
2. it is one of the core web technologies along with css and javasccript.

        - <p> is the opening tag.
        - 'EXAMPLE' is the content.

3. there are lot of attributes in html and one of them is source attribute.
4. <img source="post.jpg" alt="this image consists of html code" />
5. 'alt' stand for alternative text.
6. 'alt' should contain some text which describes the image because it will be used in the search engines which helps identify the browser what is in the image.
7. this will be also very helpfull for the blind people beacuse the device will read the alternative text which will describe the image to that blind people.
8. <img source="post.jpg" width="500" height="200" />
9. height and width property can be set to the images using attributes.

12. <html lang="en"></html> for english.
13. <html lang="de"></html> for german.
14. <html lang="pt"></html> for portuguese.

1. we can place links into two big categories.
2. links that point to other pages within our own websites.
3. links that point to outside of our website.
4. 'a' tag is called Hyperlinks/anchor tag.
5. <a href="paste mdn website link" >MDN Web Docs</a>
6. we can place the link inside a paragraph tag.
7. we can also open a link in the new tab using 'target' attribute.
8. <a href="..." target="_blank" >MDN Web Docs</a>
9. in the above example, we used link which points to outside of our website.
10. <a href="file_name.html">contacts page</a>
11. in the above example, we used link which points to inside of our website.
12. <a href="#">goto top of our page</a>
13. this moves to the top of our webpage.

# ------------------------- 15. Structuring our Page ------------------------- #
1. 'nav' stands for navigation and wrap the anchor tags inside it.

# ------------------------ 16. A Note on Semantic HTML ----------------------- #
1. in html semantic means is that certain elements have actually a meaning or a purpose attached to them.
2. so when we think a certain html element, we should actually not think about what that element look like as it's rendered on the page but instead, we should think about what that element actually means and what it stands for.
3. so that is basically the definition of semantic html.
4. not all elements in html are semantic.
5. semantic html helps in seo optimization.
