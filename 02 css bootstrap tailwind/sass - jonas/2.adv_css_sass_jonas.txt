# ----------------------- SOME COLORS MIGHT BE USEFULL ----------------------- #
✅ 1. light green - #7ed56f
✅ 2. medium green - #55c57a
✅ 3. dark green - #28b485

# ------------------------- BUILDING HEADER PART - 1 ------------------------- #
✅ 1. always use header tag to create navigation part.
✅ 2. use "header" as class_name.
✅ 3. follow the basic reset settings to neglect default spacings.
🚩🚩🚩🚩
    * {
        margin: 0;
        padding: 0;
        box-sizing: border-box;
    }
⚡⚡⚡⚡

✅ 4. these are enough to reset the browser defaults.
✅ 5. then add font to the body which is then inherited by all the elements in the body tag.
🚩🚩🚩🚩
    body {
        font-family: "Lato", sans-serif;
        font-weight: 400;
        font-size: 16px;
        line-height: 1.7;
        color: #777; // grey shade
        padding: 30px;
    }
⚡⚡⚡⚡

✅ 6. dont forget to add the google cdn for the font "Lato".
✅ 7. next we add styles to the header class.
🚩🚩🚩🚩
    .header {
        height: 95vh;
        background-image: linear-gradient(to right bottom, rgba( 126, 213, 111, 0.8 ), rgba( 40, 180, 131, 0.8 )), url(../file_location); // with opacity rgba
        background-size: cover; // cover-fits inside the box
        background-position: top;  // top position is fixed
    }
⚡⚡⚡⚡

✅ 8. to clip out image we use "clip-path" which is a mordern css feature.
🚩🚩🚩🚩
    .header {
        clip-path: polygon (0 0, 100% 0, 100% 75vh, 0 100%);
    }
⚡⚡⚡⚡

✅ 9. there are many "clip-path" designs we can do.
✅ 10. check the below webite for custom shapes.
✅ 11. bennettfeely.com/clippy/

# ------------------------- BUILDING HEADER PART - 2 ------------------------- #
✅ 1. learning transform feature is really very important in modern css.
✅ 2. first add the logo image inside the header top left corner.
✅ 3. remember img tag is a inline element so wrap it inside a div.
✅ 4. name div class_name as "logo-box" and img class_name as "logo".
🚩🚩🚩🚩
    .logo-box {
        position: absolute;
        top: 40px;
        left: 40px;
    }
⚡⚡⚡⚡

✅ 5. css dont know which element it should take the relative.
✅ 6. so we need to specify that also.
🚩🚩🚩🚩
    .header {
        position: relative;
    }
⚡⚡⚡⚡
    
✅ 7. next we are going to set the height of the img tag.
🚩🚩🚩🚩
    .logo {
        height: 35px;
    }
⚡⚡⚡⚡

✅ 8. by setting the height property css will automatically adjust the width based on the height.
✅ 9. so remember just specify the height property.
✅ 10. now create a h1 tag and 2 span elements inside it.
✅ 11. class_name "heading-primary" for h1.
✅ 12. class_name "heading-primary-main" for 1st span.
✅ 13. class_name "heading-primary-sub" for 2st span.
🚩🚩🚩🚩
    .heading-primary {
        color: #fff // white color
        text-transform: uppercase;
    }
⚡⚡⚡⚡

✅ 14. span element by default is a inline element, so change it to block.
🚩🚩🚩🚩
    .heading-primary-main {
        display: block;
        font-size: 60px;
        font-weight: 400;
        letter-spacing: 35px;
    }

    .heading-primary-sub {
        display: block;
        font-size: 20px;
        font-weight: 700;
        letter-spacing: 17.4px; 
    }
⚡⚡⚡⚡

✅ 15. to display the h1 in middle center of the header in verticaal and horizontal position.
✅ 16. to do so wrap it inside a div and name the class_name as "text-box".
🚩🚩🚩🚩
    .text-box {
        position: absolute;
        top: 50%;
        left: 50%;
        transform: translate( -50%, -50% );
    }
⚡⚡⚡⚡

# -------------------------- CREATING CSS ANIMATIONS ------------------------- #
✅ 1. now we are going to add animations using keyframes.
✅ 2. inside keyframes we specify the start to end animattions in percentages.
✅ 3. we can add any percentages in keyframes from 0 to 100.
🚩🚩🚩🚩
    @keyframes moveInLeft {
        0% {
            opacity: 0;
            transform: translateX(-100px);
        }

        80% {
            transform: translateX(10px);
        }

        100% {
            opacity: 1;
            transform: translate(0);
        }
    }
⚡⚡⚡⚡

✅ 4. after creating animations add it inside h1 span1 heading class.
🚩🚩🚩🚩
    .heading-primary-main {
        animation-name: moveInLeft;
        animation-duration: 1s;
        animation-timing-function: ease-out;
    }
⚡⚡⚡⚡

✅ 5. some other animation properties.

    [ animation-delay: 3s; ] this delays the animation start time.
    [ animation-iteration-count: 3; ] this repeats the animation.

✅ 6. now create a animation for span2 inside the h1 that move in right direction.
🚩🚩🚩🚩
    @keyframes moveInRight {
        0% {
            opacity: 0;
            transform: translateX(100px);
        }

        80% {
            transform: translateX(-10px);
        }

        100% {
            opacity: 1;
            transform: translate(0);
        }
    }
⚡⚡⚡⚡

✅ 7. this is similar to the moveInLeft but the direction is in the opposite.
✅ 8. there is a shorthand property which specifies all animation in a single line.
🚩🚩🚩🚩
    .heading-primary-sub {
        animation: moveInRight 1s ease-out;
    }
⚡⚡⚡⚡

✅ 9. some times there will be a slight vertical glitch which occurs in animation.
✅ 10. but there is a solution for that.
✅ 11. just add this property in the parent element of the animation element.
🚩🚩🚩🚩
    .heading-primary {
        backface-visibility: hidden;
    }
⚡⚡⚡⚡

✅ 12. when transforming element there will be some back part glitch, its visibility is hidden by this property.

# ---------------- BUILDING A COMPLEX ANIMATED BUTTON - PART 1 --------------- #
✅ 1. create a button under the h1 tag but inside the div of text-box.
✅ 2. add class_names as "btn btn-white".
✅ 3. since this the white color button.
🚩🚩🚩🚩
    .btn:link,
    .btn:visited {
        text-transform: uppercase;
        text-decoration: none;
        padding: 15px 40px;
        display: inline-block;
    }

    .btn-white {
        background-color: #fff; // white color
        color: #777; // grey shade
    }
⚡⚡⚡⚡

✅ 4. inline elements are considered as text so add text center to the parent  will make the button horizontally center.
🚩🚩🚩🚩
    .text-box {
       text-align: center;
    }
⚡⚡⚡⚡

✅ 5.when hover we need to add animation to the button.
🚩🚩🚩🚩
    .btn:hover {
        transform: translateY(-3px);
    }
⚡⚡⚡⚡

✅ 6. we also need to add animation when clicked.
🚩🚩🚩🚩
    .btn:active {
        transform: translateY(-1px); 
    }
⚡⚡⚡⚡

✅ 7. now add border radius to the button.
🚩🚩🚩🚩
    .btn:link,
    .btn:visited {
        border-radius: 100px;
    }
⚡⚡⚡⚡

✅ 8. to add animation run smoothly we add the transition property in the initial state.
🚩🚩🚩🚩
    .btn:link,
    .btn:visited {
        transition: all .2s;
    }
⚡⚡⚡⚡

✅ 9. now adding box shadow in hover state.
🚩🚩🚩🚩
    .btn:hover {
        box-shadow: 0 10px 20px rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.2); // shadow downwards
    }
⚡⚡⚡⚡

✅ 10. now adding box shadow in active state which is smaller than the hover state.
🚩🚩🚩🚩
    .btn:active {
        box-shadow: 0 5px 10px rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.2); // shadow downwards
    }
⚡⚡⚡⚡

# -------------------------------- BUILDING A COMPLEX ANIMATED BUTTON - PART 2 #

✅ 1. this is for animation when we hover the button.
✅ 2. watch the video to see detailed instructions.
✅ 3. this is based on the scaling animation.

# ---------------- THREE PILLARS OF WRITING GOOD HTML AND CSS ---------------- #
✅ 1. responsive design - [ fluid layouts, media queries, responsive images, correct units, desktop-first vs mobile-first ].
✅ 2. maintainable and scalable code - [ clean, easy-to-understand, growth, reusable, how to organize files, how to name classes, how to structure HTML ].
✅ 3. web performance - [ less HTTP requests, less code, compress code, less images, compress images ].

# ---------------------- HOW CSS WORKS BEHIND THE SCENES --------------------- #
✅ 1. first the browser starts to load the initial html file.
✅ 2. the html file is then parsed which means that it decodes the code line by line.
✅ 3. from this process the browser builds the DOM. 
✅ 4. DOM describes the entire web document, like a tree like structure.
✅ 5. as the browser parses the html, it also finds the style sheets included in the html head, and it starts loading them as well.
✅ 6. like html css is also parsed, but the parsing of css is a bit more complex.
✅ 7. during the css parsing phase there are two main steps.
✅ 8. in first step the conflicting css declarations are resolved through a process known as the cascade.
✅ 9. in second step the final css values are processed like converting margin units from percentage to pixels.
✅ 10. after parsing phase CSS object model is created like a tree like structure called CSSOM similar to the DOM.
✅ 11. these parsed DOM and CSSOM is stored together in a tree called RENDER TREE.
✅ 12. with that we need everthing that we need to render a page.
✅ 13. in order to render a page we need a visual formatting model.
✅ 14. visual formatting model renders our page in the final step.

# ---------- HOW CSS IS PARSED, PART 1: THE CASCADE AND SPECIFICITY ---------- #
✅ 1. cascade - process of combining different stylesheets and resolving conflicts between different css rules and declarations, when more than one rule applies to a certain element.

# ------------------------------- WHAT IS SASS? ------------------------------ #
✅ 1. sass is a css preprocessor, an extension of css that adds power and elegance to the basic language.
✅ 2. SASS SOURCE CODE -> SASS COMPILER -> COMPILED CSS CODE.
✅ 3. we write a sass code and a compiler converts the sass code into regular css code.
✅ 4. there are other preprocessor like LESS and STYLUS but SASS is the popular one.
✅ 5. features offered by sass,
    # variables: for reusable values such as colors, font-sizes, spacing, etc.
    # nesting: to nest selectors inside of one another, allowing us to write less code.
    # operators: for mathematical operations right inside of css.
    # partials and imports: to write CSS in different files and importing them all into one single file.
    # mixins: to write reusable pieces of CSS code.
    # functions: similar to mixins, with the difference that they produce a value that can than be used.
    # extends: to make different selectors inherit declarations that are common to all of them.
    # control directives: for writing complex code using conditionals and loops.
✅ 6. there are two SASS syntaxes used dont get confused by that.
✅ 7. the sass syntax orginal one dont get the curly braces and indentative sensitive.
✅ 8. it is little bit complicated and most of the developers use less often.
✅ 9. the second one is the SCSS which is called sassy CSS which looks similar to original css with curly braces.
✅ 10. this is the main difference between sass and scss.

# --------------- FIRST STEPS WITH SASS: VARIABLES AND NESTING --------------- #
✅ 1. to use sass in our local system, we need sass to be installed.
✅ 2. for learning purpose use codepen website.
✅ 3. open a new project, and change css preprocessor to scss in the settings.
✅ 4. in sass variables are like containers that stores data, for example like variable color.
✅ 5. by this variable we declare it only once and we can use it many times.
✅ 6. so any change we want to change to the variable it will reflect in all places we used.
✅ 7. in sass we use comments as below.

    // sass comments
    /* css comments */

✅ 8. sass identifies a variable using dollor sign ( $ ).
✅ 9. ampersand symbol ( & ) represent the last navigation block and it is mainly used for pseudo classes.
