DATABASE:

~> it's a collection of data, a method for accessing and manipulating that data.
~> data is everywhere and it is the most valuable commodity in the world.
~> everyday we deal with tons of data like drone footages, camera photos, location data and many more.
~> databases aren't anything special, they're just hardware and software, there's just computers.
~> hardware is the mechanical part and the software is the actual code on top that allows usto collect and use the data really useful.
~> without data no websites can work
~> drum memory was used initially to store data before disk drive was introduced.
~> drum memory is a cylindrical shaped and thats why databases have cylindrical icons.
<------------------------------->

WHAT IS A DATABASE ?

~> database is a system, hardware and software that allows a user to store, organize and use data.
<------------------------------->

DATABASE BRANDS:

~> maria db, microsoft sql server, cassandra, mongo db, my sql, oracle database, redis, sql lite, postgres sql, ibm db2 and many more
<------------------------------->

THINGS TO KNOW IN DATABASE:

1. how to put data in db
2. how to use/update/learn from data
3. how to remove data
<------------------------------->

CONFUSING ACRONYMS:

DBMS - DataBase Management System
RDBMS - Relational DataBase Management System
SQL - Structured Query Language
<------------------------------->

5 DATA MODELS:

--> relational model [ mysql, postgres ] [ most popular, e-comerce ]
--> document model [ mongo db, firebase ] [ data in document ]
--> key value model [ dinamo db ] [ simplest way to access data ]
--> graph model [ more complex, data connected in differentways, social media uses these model ]
--> wide columnar model [ newly introduced ] [ cassandra, google big table ]
<------------------------------->

WHAT IS SQL ?

~> SQL is a language that is used to talk to a databases.
~> SQL statement is nothing but a Query
~> SELECT * FROM USERS
~> the above is the Query or SQL Statement
<------------------------------->

QUERY BREAKDOWN:

SELECT NAME FROM USERS WHERE ROLE = 'MANAGER';

NAME --> identifier
WHERE --> keyword
ROLE = 'MANAGER' --> condition
'MANAGER' --> expression
<------------------------------->

DECLARATIVE VS IMPERATIVE

<------------------------------->

DATABAS MODEL:

~> HIERARCHICAL [ TREE LIKE FLOW CHART DESIGN ]
~> NETWORKING 
~> ENTITY-RELATIONSHIP
~> RELATIONAL
~> OBJECT ORIENTED
~> FLAT
~> SEMI-STRUCTURED
<------------------------------->

CRUD:
c --> create
r --> read
u --> update
d --> delete
<------------------------------->

TABLE:

~> table is the representation of object
~> each table has its name
~> each column represent specific types of data
~> each row represent singular piece of data
<------------------------------->

COLUMN:

~> each column has its own name
~> collection of columns is called degree
~> we can specify what data should be put in that column and that concept is called domain/constraint
~> column is also called as attributes
<------------------------------->

ROWS:

~> rows are also called as tuples
~> tuple is nothing but single record of data
~> tuples is nothing but multiple record of data
~> each tuples must follow the column constraint
~> collection of rows/tuples is called cardinallity
<------------------------------->

PRIMARY KEY AND FOREIGN KEY:

~> primary key uniquely identify data in the table
~> foreign key is used to add data to the main table but it is a primary key in the secondary table
~> foreign key is used to make a relationship between two or more tables
<------------------------------->

OLTP vs OLAP:

~> realtional databases support day to day office work and support in analysis
~> OLTP --> ONLINE TRANSACTION PROCESSING
~> OLAP --> ONLINE ANALYTICAL PROCESSING

exercise: [ OLTP and OLAP ]
1. a database is being used to log orders and customers --> OLTP 
2. a database is being used to figure out what new products we should offer --> OLAP
3. a database is being used to derive statistics for reporting to the executives --> OLAP
4. a database is being used to keep track of logged in users --> OLTP
<------------------------------->

POSTGRESS DEFAULTS:

~> url - localhost
~> port - 5432
~> username - postgres
~> password - root
~> connection url - local host
<------------------------------->

SQL COMMANDS:

~> DDL --> [ CREATE, ALTER, DROP, RENAME, TRUNCATE, COMMENT ] [ DATA DEFINITION LANGUAGE ]
~> DQL --> [ SELECT ] [ DATA QUERY LANGUAGE ]
~> DML --> [ INSERT, UPDATE, DELETE, MERGE, CALL, EXPLAIN PLAN, LOCK TABLE ] [ DATA MODIFICATION LANGUAGE ]
~> DCL --> [ GRANT, REVOKE ] [ DATA CONTROL LANGUAGE ]
<------------------------------->
