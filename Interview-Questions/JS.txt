What is the correct way to get the index of the first occurrence of a substring in a string in JavaScript?
// Example string 
const originalString = "This is a sample string"; 

// Target substring 
const targetSubstring = "sample"; 

// Finding the index of the first occurrence of the target substring 
const index = originalString.indexOf(targetSubstring); 

console.log("Index of the first occurrence:", index);
