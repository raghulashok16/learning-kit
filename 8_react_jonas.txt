# ---------------------- destructuring objects and array --------------------- #
1. destructuring allow us to access single or multiple values in a single line.

    const {title, author} = bookObject;

2. the name we use to destruct must be same as the key name in the object.
3. this is very helpfull when we work with api.
4. for array destructuring, we can use the same way but we should use a square bracket instead of cury braces.

    const [firstElement, SecondElement, ThirdElement] = ourArray;

# -------------------------- rest / spread operator -------------------------- #
1. rest operator is used to store the remaining values into our required operation.
2. in array destructuring we can use rest operator to store excess element in a array.

        const [firstElement, ...otherElements] = ourArray;

3. in array destructuring it is mandatory to use rest operator at end.
4. if we destruct a element after rest operator it will result in a error.
5. the main use of spread operator
